# Virtual Wallet PWA

Virtual Wallet is a React Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help you manage virtual piggy banks (cagnottes), track your expenses and income. It allows you to organize your personal finances by creating multiple virtual wallets for different purposes (vacations, savings, transportation, etc.).

## Features

- 🏦 **Multiple Virtual Wallets (Cagnottes)**: Create and manage multiple virtual wallets
- 💰 **Expense & Income Tracking**: Track expenses (dépenses) and income (recettes) for each wallet
- 📊 **Real-time Balance**: See current balance and target amount for each wallet
- 📱 **PWA Support**: Install as a mobile app for offline access
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light themes
- 💱 **Multi-currency**: Support for EUR, CAD, and USD
- 📈 **Entry History**: View complete history of all entries grouped by wallet
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

### Google Analytics Configuration

To enable Google Analytics tracking, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your Google Analytics Measurement ID (GA4). You can find it in your [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) account under Admin → Data Streams.

**Note:** The `.env` file is committed to the repository, so the same configuration will be used for both local development and production builds.

**Important:** Google Analytics is **only enabled in production builds** (`npm run build`). During development (`npm run dev`), tracking is disabled to avoid polluting your analytics data with test traffic. The application will automatically initialize Google Analytics in production when the `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable is set.

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically sets `NODE_ENV=production` during the build process and uses the `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` secret, so Google Analytics will be enabled in production deployments.

**Debugging:** Check the browser console for `[GA Debug]` messages to verify that Google Analytics is loading correctly.

For Docker development:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec web npm start
```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Quality & Testing

- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Format: `npx prettier --check .`
- Unit tests: `npm test`

## Offline Support

The service worker pre-caches the app shell (`index.html`, manifest, icons) and caches GET requests for offline functionality.

## PWA Installation

On iOS (Safari): `Share` → `Add to Home Screen`.

On desktop (Chrome/Edge): `Install` icon in the address bar.

## Testing on Mobile with LocalTunnel

LocalTunnel allows you to expose your local server on the internet with a public URL, to test on your mobile device.

### Installing LocalTunnel

```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
```

### Usage

1. **Start the development server** (in a first terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   The server will be accessible on `http://localhost:5173`

2. **Create the tunnel** (in a second terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run tunnel
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   lt --port 5173 --print-requests
   ```

3. **Get your public URL**:
   - LocalTunnel will give you a URL like `https://xxxxx.loca.lt`
   - This URL will be accessible from any device connected to the internet

4. **Test on your mobile**:
   - Open this URL in your mobile device's browser
   - Make sure your mobile and your computer are on the same Wi-Fi network (or use mobile data)

### Useful Options

- **Custom URL** (if available):
  ```bash
  lt --port 5173 --subdomain my-app
  ```

- **With Docker**:
  If you're using Docker, you can also create the tunnel from your host machine:
  ```bash
  lt --port 5173
  ```

### Important Notes

- The LocalTunnel URL changes every time (unless you use `--subdomain`)
- The tunnel remains active as long as the process is running
- HTTP/HTTPS requests are displayed in the terminal with `--print-requests`
- For production use, use a service like ngrok (paid) or a VPS
